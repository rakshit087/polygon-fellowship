# Polygon Fellowship Assignments

Polygon fellowship is an exclusive, eight-week mentor-led programme that will assist us in learning and honing our Web3 skills. Each week we are given a task to complete. I will use this repository to share my progress and feedback.

~~Seperate branches have been created for each week's work.~~
Update: As the weeks are progressing, the tasks are becoming more complex. So I have decided to work on seprate repositories.
Although I will be maintaining this repo as an overall progress tracker.
